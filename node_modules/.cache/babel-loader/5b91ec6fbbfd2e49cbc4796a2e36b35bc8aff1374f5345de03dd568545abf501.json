We basically grew up together, from our awkward kid days to the young adults we are now.\n\nWhen I think about it, those 12 years weren’t just measured in time. They were measured in laughter, inside jokes, random arguments, late-night conversations, and all the countless memories we’ve shared. \n\nAnd out of those years, we never had the most bad bitch photos together 😭 Baka ganon talaga pag meant to be😍\n\nMay this new chapter of your life make you stronger and tougher than ever. You are now a year closer to your success, and as your best friend who have basically grown with you, I know that everything you’re doing now—your efforts, your courage, and your determination to strive- will bring you to the life you deserve. \n\nYou’re one of the hardest-working people I know, and I am very proud of you. I will always be your number one supporter in everything you do. \n\nI apologize for my shortcomings, especially in those times you might have needed me, but I wasn't there. Still, know that I’m here for you whenever you need me. I know lately we’re not having chikas as much as before na (ala e magkaiba tayong campus hirap makakalap ng chismis), but I hope that won’t stop us from being BEST friends.\n\nHonestly, you set my standards so high in friendship that I can’t look at my other friends the way I look at you.   We both may feel like life is unfair to us, but I am very thankful na hindi ka ipinutok ni daddy Wilson sa kumot, Kac kung hindi wala akong pretty bff 😍 Miserable man ang buhai pareho naman tayong maganda, mas maganda ka lang ngayon mga 0.5% tutal birthday mo naman.\n\nAlways remember that I’ll always stay, even when everyone, or even the whole world, becomes against you. I may not be the most useful friend you have, but I’ll always be the friend you can be whatever you want to be with. Happy birthday, bff! I wish nothing but the best for you at sana labasan ka na.
